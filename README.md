# Java_BreadBoard_Simulator
The Objective of the project would be to develop a JAVA Applet which displays the image of a breadboard and allows components to be selected for the circuit. Once a circuit has been defined, the user can then select various input from a set of available inputs. The project could focus exclusively on analog or digital circuits, or take a general approach and allow both types of components to be used. There will be some graphics involved as part of the JAVA programming.
