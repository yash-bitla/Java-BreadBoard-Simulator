# Java_BreadBoard_Simulator
The Objective of the project would be to develop a JAVA Applet which displays the image of a breadboard and allows components to be selected for the circuit. Once a circuit has been defined, the user can then select various input from a set of available inputs. The project could focus exclusively on analog or digital circuits, or take a general approach and allow both types of components to be used. There will be some graphics involved as part of the JAVA programming.
However, the problem using a real-life breadboard is that,students may not be able to experiment outside of scheduled lab time without supervision. If a breadboard simulation were available online it would greatly enhance learning resources for these students. 
Also it prevents from any kind of electrical issues like short-ciruit and very well prevents the threat to life.
Most bread boards can handle up to 1A through their connections at digital-level voltages (5V and below).  Even so, I would really try to limit current through any breadboard to the 500mA range.
Over time, the little clips and springs that make up the connections inside the breadboard wear out.  If you push a wire in too far (and too hard) you may make unintended connections.  As you change connections around, you might bump a wire or resistor sticking up which may make (or break) a connection.
